The reset token is generated automatically by AWS Cognito and is passed in the API call to authorize the reset attempt. Users receive feedback on their reset password attempt via form based error messaging, showing the specific field which caused the new password to be rejected. This is convenient as it shows users more detailed information about what needs to be changed for the new password. Upon successful reset, users are redirected to the sign-in page and complete the sequence.</p>
